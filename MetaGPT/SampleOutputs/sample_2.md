--- Architecture ---

## Architecture Overview
- The system is a web-based application for a coffee shop, providing customers with a user-friendly interface to order and pay for their favorite coffee drinks.  
- The application will have a frontend built using React.js, providing a responsive and accessible user interface.
- The backend will handle payment processing, customer information storage, account management, and notification systems.
- The system will ensure secure payment processing and customer information storage.

## Modules/Components
- **Frontend Module**: Built using React.js, responsible for user interface and user experience.
- **Payment Gateway Module**: Handles secure payment processing.
- **Customer Information Module**: Stores and manages customer information securely.
- **Account Management Module**: Handles account creation, login, and management functionality.
- **Admin Dashboard Module**: Provides an interface for the coffee shop owner to manage customer accounts, payment history, and menu items.
- **Notification System Module**: Sends notifications and reports to the coffee shop owner.
- **Database Module**: Stores and retrieves data for the application.

## Interfaces
- **User Interface (UI)**: Provides an interactive interface for customers to order and pay for coffee drinks.
- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: Handles communication between the frontend and backend modules.
- **Payment Gateway API**: Integrates with the payment gateway to process payments securely.
- **Database Interface**: Handles data storage and retrieval for the application.

## Architecture Diagram
- Frontend Module -> API -> Backend Module
- Backend Module -> Payment Gateway API -> Payment Gateway Module
- Backend Module -> Database Interface -> Database Module
- Backend Module -> Notification System Module
- Admin Dashboard Module -> API -> Backend Module
- Database Module -> Database Interface -> Backend Module

## System Flow
1. The customer interacts with the Frontend Module to order and pay for coffee drinks.
2. The Frontend Module sends a request to the Backend Module through the API.
3. The Backend Module processes the request and interacts with the Payment Gateway Module to process the payment.
4. The Payment Gateway Module sends a response to the Backend Module, which then updates the Database Module.
5. The Backend Module sends a response to the Frontend Module, which then updates the user interface.
6. The coffee shop owner interacts with the Admin Dashboard Module to manage customer accounts, payment history, and menu items.
7. The Admin Dashboard Module sends a request to the Backend Module through the API.
8. The Backend Module processes the request and updates the Database Module.
9. The Backend Module sends a response to the Admin Dashboard Module, which then updates the user interface.
10. The Notification System Module sends notifications and reports to the coffee shop owner.
