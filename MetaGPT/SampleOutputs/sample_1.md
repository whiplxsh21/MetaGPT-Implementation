--- Architecture ---

## Architecture Overview
- The system is a task management application that allows users to create, edit, and delete to-do list items with features such as categorization, deadline and reminder setting, and integration with popular calendar apps.
- The application will have a user-friendly interface for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on to-do list items, a dashboard to display all to-do list items with filtering and sorting capabilities, and a schedule view for day/week/month with upcoming deadlines.
- The system will be designed with a responsive layout to ensure accessibility on various devices and browsers.
- The application will have a robust data storage and backup system to prevent loss of user data.

## Modules/Components
- **Authentication Module**: Handles user authentication and authorization using email and password.
- **To-Do List Module**: Manages CRUD operations on to-do list items, including categorization, deadline and reminder setting, and filtering.
- **Dashboard Module**: Displays all to-do list items with filtering and sorting capabilities.
- **Schedule Module**: Displays a schedule view for day/week/month with upcoming deadlines.
- **Calendar Integration Module**: Integrates with popular calendar apps to schedule tasks.
- **Notification Module**: Implements reminder and notification system for upcoming deadlines.
- **Data Storage Module**: Handles data storage and backup to prevent loss of user data.
- **UI Module**: Provides a user-friendly interface for the application.

## Interfaces
- **User Interface (UI)**: A user-friendly interface for the application that allows users to interact with the system.
- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: A programming interface that allows different modules to communicate with each other.
- **Database Interface**: An interface that allows the application to interact with the database.
- **Calendar API**: An interface that allows the application to integrate with popular calendar apps.

## Architecture Diagram
- The system will have a layered architecture with the following layers:
  - **Presentation Layer**: UI Module
  - **Application Layer**: To-Do List Module, Dashboard Module, Schedule Module, Calendar Integration Module, Notification Module
  - **Business Layer**: Authentication Module, Data Storage Module
  - **Data Access Layer**: Database Interface
  - **Infrastructure Layer**: Calendar API, Notification API

The flow of the system will be as follows:
1. The user interacts with the UI Module (Presentation Layer).
2. The UI Module sends requests to the Application Layer.
3. The Application Layer processes the requests and sends requests to the Business Layer.
4. The Business Layer processes the requests and sends requests to the Data Access Layer.
5. The Data Access Layer interacts with the database and returns data to the Business Layer.
6. The Business Layer processes the data and returns it to the Application Layer.
7. The Application Layer processes the data and returns it to the UI Module.
8. The UI Module displays the data to the user.

The system will also have a separate flow for notifications and calendar integration:
1. The Notification Module (Application Layer) sends requests to the Notification API (Infrastructure Layer).
2. The Notification API sends notifications to the user.
3. The Calendar Integration Module (Application Layer) sends requests to the Calendar API (Infrastructure Layer).
4. The Calendar API integrates with the calendar app and schedules tasks.
